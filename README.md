# Rock, Paper, Scissors - AI Web App

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built as a web app using **Python and Gradio**. The game lets users pick between **Rock, Paper, or Scissors** and plays against an AI opponent that makes a random choice. The result is displayed immediately in the web interface.

This project was built as part of a programming assignment and focuses on:
- Python fundamentals (functions, conditionals, randomness)
- Web-based interaction using **Gradio**
- Using **uv** for package management
- Proper version control with **GitHub**

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run the project:

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlowGodPR/ml-rock-paper-scissors.git
cd ml-rock-paper-scissors
```

### **2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment**
Since we are using `uv`, we need to create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
```
(For Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`)

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Install **Gradio** and other required packages:
```bash
uv pip install gradio
```

### **4️⃣ Run the App**
Start the Rock, Paper, Scissors web app:
```bash
python3 app.py
```
A browser window will open where you can play the game.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
ml-rock-paper-scissors/
│── app.py           # Main Python script
│── readme.md        # This README file
│── .venv/           # Virtual environment (ignored in Git)
```

## 🎮 How It Works
1. **User selects** "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" from the web interface.
2. **AI makes a random choice** using Python's `random.choice()`.
3. **The game determines the winner** based on standard Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.
4. **The result is displayed** in the web interface.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Simple UI powered by **Gradio**  
✅ Fully interactive in the browser  
✅ Uses **randomized AI logic** for fairness  
✅ Works inside a **virtual environment** for clean dependencies  
✅ Follows best practices for **Git & version control**  

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
If `gradio` is not found, make sure you've activated the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
If issues persist, reinstall dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install --upgrade gradio
```

## 📌 Notes
- This project is meant as a **beginner-friendly introduction** to Python web apps.
- Built following **best practices** in package management and Git workflow.
- Future improvements could include **score tracking, animations, or an AI difficulty setting**.
